This calculator uses postfix notation and the Shunting Yard algorithm to solve mathematical expressions.


Current functionality includes:
  - solving a standard expression; including the following functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, trigonometric functions, logarithms, exponents, square roots; the calculator also includes common mathematical constants pi and e.
  - saving a history of all executed expressions for the current user session.
  - conversion of standard expressions to expressions that use the postfix notation (often called Reverse Polish Notation) using the Shunting Yard algorithm.
  

Developed and used with Python 3.5.1
